# CursorRules: Get Your Bearings

[ROADMAP.md](mdc:exp/ROADMAP.md) [sanity-check-me.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/sanity-check-me.mdc) [pipeline.log](mdc:exp/pipeline.log) 

## Mission
Ensure every execution begins with a clear understanding of the current state before proceeding. Avoid premature action without validation.

## Key Steps

1. **Pause** – Stop and assess the situation before making changes.  
2. **Review** – Check recent the logfile pipeline.log, modifications, roadmap alignment, and pending tasks.  
3. **Clarify** – Ensure all required context is available before execution.  
4. **Validate** – Look for a `!proceed` signal before moving forward.

## Critical Checks

- Is there a clear directive to proceed?  
- Does the current state match expectations?  
- Are there any blockers, ambiguities, or missing context?  

## Goal
Prevent unnecessary or premature actions. Stay aligned, verify intent, and move forward only when the path is clear.

the presence of the !proceed in the rule's context might indicate that it's okay to proceed unless there are ambiguities.
