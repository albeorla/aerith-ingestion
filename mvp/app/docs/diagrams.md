Below is a non-exhaustive but fairly comprehensive overview of many diagram types used in modern software development. Each diagram type has a unique focus and provides different perspectives on systems, processes, and data.

| **Diagram Type**                              | **Description / Purpose**                                                                                                                                                         | **Common Tools / Notation**                                                                          | **Additional Notes**                                                                                                               |

| **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**                   | Focuses on how data moves through a system: sources, transformations, data stores, and destinations. Classic in structured analysis.                                              | Gane & Sarson or Yourdon-DeMarco notations; Tools: Lucidchart, Visual Paradigm                       | Good for data-centric system analyses.

Tools: draw.io, Miro, Lucidchart                 | Often used with stakeholders. Might combine with cloud icons (AWS, Azure, GCP) to depict deployment.                               |
| **Deployment / Infrastructure Diagram**       | Illustrates servers, containers, networks, firewall boundaries, and how software is deployed in an environment (physically or virtually).                                         | UML Deployment Diagrams, or ad-hoc icons for AWS, Azure, GCP; Tools: draw.io, Lucidchart, Cloud Skew | Overlaps with UML Deployment but often done informally with vendor icons. Helps Ops/DevOps people see the physical/virtual layout. |
| **Sequence of Microservices**                 | A specialized sequence diagram that focuses on how microservices or APIs interact over time.                                                                                      | UML Sequence notation or custom “timeline” style; Tools: Lucidchart, PlantUML                        | Useful for distributed systems to highlight request flows across services.                                                         |

A table-based approach can be more explicit for certain real-time systems.               |
| **SysML Diagrams**                            | A suite of diagrams (Block Definition, Internal Block, Parametric, etc.) designed for systems engineering. Some overlap with UML but more specialized.                            | SysML notation; Tools: Cameo Systems Modeler, Enterprise Architect                                   | Used in complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects (hardware + software).                                                    |
| **Interaction Overview Diagram (UML)**        | Combines elements of activity diagrams and sequence diagrams, providing a high-level view of control flow with references to subordinate interaction diagrams.                    | UML notation; Tools: UML modeling software (Visual Paradigm, StarUML)                                | Less commonly used in day-to-day software dev, but can be helpful in large or sophisticated UML models.                            |

> **Note:**
>
> - Many of these diagrams overlap in functionality. For example, a “Deployment Diagram” can be done either in strict UML or in a free-form “Cloud architecture” style with AWS/Azure icons.
> - The **C4 model** is a popular modern approach that covers system context, containers, components, and (optionally) code with a simpler notation than UML, well-suited to many agile teams.
> - **BPMN** is often used in enterprise or business process contexts, where a more robust notation than a simple flowchart is needed.
> - **UML** itself has 14 standard diagram types, but many teams only use a handful (Class, Sequence, Use Case, Activity, Component, Deployment).

This table should give you a good sense of the landscape of diagramming options. In practice, you’ll likely choose just a few of these (e.g., **C4 + ERD + BPMN**) depending on your domain, your stakeholder needs, and your engineering culture.
