# Parking Lot Items

## High Priority (Consider for Next Sprint)

1. **Implementation Code from 02_code_model_1.md**
   - Mental models implementation
   - AI reasoning algorithms
   - Agent framework core components
   - Rationale: These components are essential for the core agent functionality

2. **SoMinE Implementation Details from 07_somine_prompt_implementation.md**
   - Complete Python implementation of core classes
   - SOLID principles application
   - Testing framework
   - Rationale: Critical for the SoMinE agent development

## Medium Priority (Consider for Future Sprints)

1. **Advanced Agent Methods from 05_holistic_list_of_agent_methods.md**
   - Debate Framework
   - Iterative Prompt Engineering
   - Memory-Augmented Agents
   - Rationale: Enhances agent capabilities but not critical for MVP

2. **Multi-Armed Bandit Implementation from 03_multi_armed_bandit_2.md**
   - Mathematical foundations
   - Implementation examples
   - Rationale: Important for strategy selection but can be implemented after core functionality

## Low Priority (Future Consideration)

1. **Sales and Marketing (from 01_sales_funnel.md)**
   - Lead Magnet Funnel strategy
   - Tripwire Funnel approach
   - Platform recommendations
   - Rationale: Not critical for technical implementation

2. **Additional Documentation**
   - API setup guides
   - Development commands
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Rationale: Can be developed incrementally as needed

## Deprecated/Removed

1. **Bi-directional Sync**
   - Removed due to complexity and lower priority
   - May reconsider in future versions

## Review Process

Items in this parking lot should be reviewed:
1. At the start of each sprint planning
2. When completing related features
3. When technical dependencies change

## Migration Criteria

To move an item from parking lot to active development:
1. All technical dependencies must be met
2. Resources must be available
3. Item must align with current sprint goals
4. ROI must be justified
