How It Works
	•	Each component is implemented and ready to run.
	•	Extend stubs with real logic for reinforcement learning and decision-making in dynamic domains.

To integrate the PyBandits library for implementing Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms into your existing framework, here’s how you can do it step-by-step:

Updated Code Framework with PyBandits

Installation

Run the following command in your terminal to install the pybandits library:

pip install git+https://github.com/PlaytikaOSS/pybandits.git

Integration into Framework

1. Update ai_reasoning_algorithms.py
We’ll modify the MultiArmedBanditAlgorithm to use pybandits for implementing the MAB logic.

from pybandits.bandits import BernoulliBandit
from typing import Dict, Any


class MultiArmedBanditAlgorithm(AIReasoningAlgorithm):
    def __init__(self, n_arms: int = 5):
        """
        Initializes a Multi-Armed Bandit using the BernoulliBandit from PyBandits.
        """
        super().__init__(
            name="Multi-Armed Bandit with PyBandits",
            description="MAB using Thompson Sampling (PyBandits library).",
            typical_applications="Online advertising, A/B testing, recommendation systems."
        )
        self.bandit = BernoulliBandit(n_arms)

    def reason(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """
        Simulates interaction with the bandit, selects an arm, updates rewards.
        """
        true_conversion_rates = context.get("true_conversion_rates", [])
        if not true_conversion_rates:
            return "[Error] Missing true conversion rates in context."

        ## Select an arm
        chosen_arm = self.bandit.select_arm()

        ## Simulate reward using the true conversion rate
        import numpy as np
        reward = np.random.binomial(1, true_conversion_rates[chosen_arm])

        ## Update the bandit's knowledge with the observed reward
        self.bandit.update(chosen_arm, reward)

        ## Return performance data
        return (
            f"Chosen arm: {chosen_arm}, "
            f"Reward: {reward}, "
            f"Arm counts: {self.bandit.counts}, "
            f"Estimated values: {self.bandit.values}"
        )

2. Update agent_framework.py
Ensure the BanditAgent class can utilize the new MultiArmedBanditAlgorithm.

from ai_reasoning_algorithms import MultiArmedBanditAlgorithm


class BanditAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, name: str, n_arms: int = 5):
        """
        Initializes a BanditAgent with a Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm.
        """
        super().__init__(name)
        self.add_ai_algorithm(MultiArmedBanditAlgorithm(n_arms=n_arms))

3. Update main.py
Use the updated framework in a real-world simulation to see the bandit in action.

from agent_framework import BanditAgent


def main():
    ## Initialize BanditAgent with 5 arms
    bandit_agent = BanditAgent(name="PyBanditAgent", n_arms=5)

    ## Define true conversion rates for the arms
    true_conversion_rates = [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3]  ## Example rates

    ## Simulate 1000 trials
    n_trials = 1000
    for _ in range(n_trials):
        request = {"true_conversion_rates": true_conversion_rates}
        result = bandit_agent.process_request(request)

    ## Final Results
    print("=== Final Bandit Results ===")
    for algo_name, algo_result in bandit_agent.process_request(request).items():
        print(f"{algo_name}: {algo_result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Expected Output

After running the simulation, the bandit will output:
	1.	Number of times each arm was selected: This indicates exploration and exploitation during the trials.
	2.	Estimated conversion rates for each arm: These estimates converge toward the true conversion rates over time.
	3.	Cumulative reward performance: Measures how well the bandit performed in selecting the best arms.

Further Extensions
	1.	Contextual Bandits:
	•	Use contextual data (e.g., user attributes) with PyBandits.
	•	Explore PyBandits integration with Bayesian inference (via PyMC3 or NumPyro).
	2.	Visualization:
	•	Add plots to visualize arm selection trends and reward accumulation.
	3.	Custom Rewards:
	•	Adapt the reward calculation logic for real-world scenarios (e.g., revenue, clicks).

This integration leverages PyBandits for robust MAB implementation and aligns seamlessly with your existing multi-agent framework.

### Multi-Armed Bandit #1

Implementing a production-grade multi-armed bandit (MAB) solution requires robust algorithms and efficient code. Several open-source Python implementations can serve as solid foundations for such systems. Here are some notable repositories:

PyBandits
Developed by Playtika, PyBandits is a Python library that provides implementations of stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit (sMAB) and contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (cMAB) algorithms based on Thompson Sampling. It supports both Bernoulli multi-armed bandits and contextual bandits utilizing PyMC3 for Bayesian inference. ￼Multi-armed Bandits by akhadangi
This repository offers implementations of several MAB algorithms, including epsilon-greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Linear UCB (contextual bandits), and Kernel UCB. It also includes well-cited papers and off-policy evaluations using datasets, making it a comprehensive resource for understanding and applying MAB algorithms. ￼MABWiser
MABWiser is an open-source Python library that implements various bandit strategies, supporting context-free, parametric, and non-parametric contextual policies. It includes built-in parallelization and simulation capabilities, facilitating the development and testing of MAB algorithms in production environments.Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms by kulinshah98
This repository provides implementations of various MAB algorithms, including epsilon-greedy and UCB, with a focus on understanding the effects of different parameters. It serves as a practical resource for experimenting with and deploying MAB solutions. ￼Multi-Armed Bandits by nicholasbaard
This Python implementation focuses on the multi-armed bandit problem using reinforcement learning techniques. It includes epsilon-greedy, optimistic initialization, and UCB methods, providing a foundation for developing MAB solutions. ￼These repositories offer a range of algorithms and implementations that can be adapted and extended to meet the specific requirements of a production environment. When integrating such solutions, it’s crucial to consider factors like scalability, real-time decision-making capabilities, and the ability to handle contextual information relevant to your application domain.

For a deeper understanding of the multi-armed bandit problem and its applications, you might find the following resources helpful:

This article provides a comprehensive introduction to the MAB problem, along with Python code examples demonstrating the epsilon-greedy method. ￼
	•	Multi-Armed Bandits in Python: Epsilon Greedy, UCB1, Bayesian UCB, and EXP3
This blog post discusses various MAB algorithms and their implementations in Python, offering insights into their performance as content recommendation systems. ￼

These resources can provide valuable insights and practical guidance as you develop and implement a multi-armed bandit solution tailored to your specific needs.

To utilize the PyBandits library for implementing Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms in Python, follow these steps:

1. Installation

First, ensure that PyBandits is installed in your environment. You can install it directly from the source using pip:

pip install git+https://github.com/PlaytikaOSS/pybandits.git

2. Importing the Library

After installation, import the necessary modules in your Python script:

from pybandits.bandits import BernoulliBandit

3. Setting Up the Bandit

Initialize the Bernoulli Bandit with the desired number of arms. For example, to create a bandit with 5 arms:

n_arms = 5
bandit = BernoulliBandit(n_arms)

4. Simulating Interactions

To simulate interactions with the bandit, iterate over a number of trials, select an arm, receive a reward, and update the bandit’s state accordingly:

import numpy as np

n_trials = 1000
true_conversion_rates = [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3]  ## Example true conversion rates for each arm

for _ in range(n_trials):
    chosen_arm = bandit.select_arm()
    reward = np.random.binomial(1, true_conversion_rates[chosen_arm])
    bandit.update(chosen_arm, reward)

In this example, true_conversion_rates represents the actual success probabilities for each arm, which are typically unknown in real-world scenarios. The select_arm method chooses an arm based on the Thompson Sampling strategy, and the update method updates the bandit’s knowledge based on the observed reward.

5. Evaluating Performance

After running the trials, you can evaluate the performance of the bandit by analyzing metrics such as the cumulative reward or the proportion of times each arm was selected:

print("Number of times each arm was selected:", bandit.counts)
print("Estimated conversion rates for each arm:", bandit.values)

Here, bandit.counts provides the number of times each arm was selected, and bandit.values gives the estimated success probability for each arm.

6. Contextual Bandits

If you have contextual information available, PyBandits also supports contextual bandits using Thompson Sampling with Bayesian inference via PyMC3. You can refer to the PyBandits GitHub repository for detailed examples and documentation on implementing contextual bandits.

Additional Resources

For a deeper understanding of the algorithms implemented in PyBandits, you may refer to the following papers:
	•	Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoffs
This paper presents a Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with linear payoffs.
	•	Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits with Gaussian Rewards
This paper extends Thompson Sampling to contextual bandits with Gaussian rewards.

These resources provide theoretical foundations that can enhance your implementation and application of MAB algorithms using PyBandits.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement and utilize the PyBandits library for your multi-armed bandit problems.
