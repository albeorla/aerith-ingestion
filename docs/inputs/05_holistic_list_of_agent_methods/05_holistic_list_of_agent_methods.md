# Holistic List of Agent Methods

## Holistic List of Agent Methods

Here is a holistic list of some of the most powerful agent methods, frameworks, and approaches designed to enhance problem-solving, reasoning, and task performance for AI and human systems. These methods emphasize modularity, reflection, and emergent problem-solving strategies:

1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning
	•	Description: A step-by-step reasoning process that breaks down complex problems into manageable components, enabling better problem decomposition and logical reasoning.
	•	Use Case: Mathematical reasoning, decision-making, and complex question answering.

2. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
	•	Description: Combines reasoning with action steps by interleaving thought processes and actions. It emphasizes dynamic decision-making based on real-time feedback.
	•	Use Case: Interactive environments, game agents, and dynamic systems.

3. Society of Mind (SoM)
	•	Description: Inspired by Marvin Minsky’s concept, this method integrates multiple specialized sub-agents working together to address complex tasks. Sub-agents may have unique capabilities and interact to share knowledge.
	•	Use Case: Large-scale AI systems, collaborative agents, and adaptive problem-solving.

4. SoMinE Prompt (Society of Mind-Inspired Engineering Prompt)
	•	Description: A structured framework incorporating sub-processes for inquiry, elicitation, reflection, and integration:
	•	Socratic Inquiry: Asking clarifying questions to fully understand the context.
	•	Minimally Elicited Instruction: Concise instructions based on context.
	•	Reflection: Analytical review to identify insights or challenges.
	•	Final Answer: Synthesizing all steps into a comprehensive solution.
	•	Use Case: Complex systems engineering, strategic planning, and nuanced reasoning.

5. Tool-Use Enhanced Agents
	•	Description: Frameworks that integrate tools (e.g., calculators, search engines, APIs) for augmented task-solving. Agents are trained to decide when and how to use tools dynamically.
	•	Use Case: Open-ended problem-solving, real-time data queries, and multimodal tasks.

6. Socratic Inquiry Method
	•	Description: A question-driven approach to uncover underlying assumptions, clarify vague details, and refine the understanding of the problem space.
	•	Use Case: Philosophy, education, and in-depth contextual exploration.

7. Self-Reflective Agents
	•	Description: Agents trained to evaluate their own actions, outputs, and reasoning iteratively. They improve performance by learning from mistakes or suboptimal decisions.
	•	Use Case: Autonomous systems, reinforcement learning, and error-prone environments.

8. Plan-and-Execute Framework
	•	Description: Divides tasks into two main phases:
	•	Planning: High-level reasoning to design a task strategy.
	•	Execution: Stepwise implementation of the plan, allowing for feedback and adjustments.
	•	Use Case: Robotics, mission-critical tasks, and AI-driven operations.

9. Self-Ask Framework
	•	Description: An agent recursively asks and answers sub-questions to systematically build up a complete solution to a complex problem.
	•	Use Case: Knowledge-based tasks, recursive reasoning, and hierarchical problem-solving.

10. Epsilon-Greedy Explorative Agents
	•	Description: Balances exploration and exploitation in decision-making by probabilistically choosing between safe, known actions and exploratory, uncertain ones.
	•	Use Case: Reinforcement learning, optimization, and adaptive exploration.

11. Debate Framework
	•	Description: Two agents argue opposing sides of a problem to refine reasoning and uncover insights. A judge (human or AI) decides based on the quality of arguments.
	•	Use Case: Ethical reasoning, policy debates, and competitive decision-making.

12. Iterative Prompt Engineering
	•	Description: Dynamically modifies and refines prompts based on intermediate outputs to achieve increasingly better results.
	•	Use Case: AI text generation, task alignment, and knowledge extrapolation.

13. Memory-Augmented Agents
	•	Description: Incorporates memory systems to retain past interactions, enabling agents to learn over time and apply context from previous tasks.
	•	Use Case: Long-term assistance, personalized systems, and adaptive agents.

14. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)
	•	Description: Explores multiple branching paths of reasoning, evaluates them iteratively, and selects the optimal path to a solution.
	•	Use Case: Complex decision trees, AI in board games, and strategic planning.

15. Reflection-Augmented CoT
	•	Description: Enhances Chain-of-Thought reasoning with periodic self-assessment and reflection on reasoning quality.
	•	Use Case: Error-prone environments, teaching AI to learn from mistakes.

16. Active Learning Framework
	•	Description: Prioritizes querying for the most informative data points, enabling efficient learning with minimal data.
	•	Use Case: Model fine-tuning, labeled data optimization, and iterative improvement.

17. Decomposition-First Approaches
	•	Description: Breaks problems into independent, manageable sub-problems before attempting to solve them collectively.
	•	Use Case: Distributed systems, modular AI, and hierarchical problem-solving.

This list provides a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and strategies for problem-solving and reasoning agents. Each method can be adapted or combined to suit specific domains or challenges.

Overview

This repository contains illustrative Python implementations for five powerful agent frameworks and approaches from the holistic list of problem-solving and reasoning methodologies:
	1.	Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning
	2.	ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
	3.	Society of Mind (SoM)
	4.	SoMinE Prompt (Society of Mind-Inspired Engineering Prompt)
	5.	Tool-Use Enhanced Agents

These implementations are simplified demonstrations of how each concept might be used to structure AI or human-in-the-loop workflows. Each approach has different strengths, ranging from step-by-step logical decomposition (CoT) to collaborative sub-agent orchestration (SoM) to dynamic usage of external tools (Tool-Use Agents).

1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning
	•	File: chain_of_thought.py
	•	Class: ChainOfThoughtAgent
	•	Description:
	•	Decomposes a complex question into smaller steps.
	•	Solves each step in sequence.
	•	Combines sub-solutions to form the final answer.

Usage

cd agent_methods
python chain_of_thought.py

Sample Output:

Question: How many prime numbers are there under 20? Also, which are they?
Answer:
Step 1 solution to 'How many prime numbers are there under 20? Also, which are they'

You would replace the _solve_subproblem method with a more rigorous solver for real-world usage.

2. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
	•	File: react_agent.py
	•	Class: ReActAgent
	•	Description:
	•	Interleaves reasoning steps with actions.
	•	Observes effects of actions or feedback from the environment.
	•	Continues the cycle until the task is complete.

Usage

python react_agent.py

Sample Output:

ReAct Agent completed the task with internal steps:
Thinking: Analyzing: Plan a trip to Paris
Action: No action required in this simplistic example
Thinking: Analyzing: Plan a trip to Paris
Action: No action required in this simplistic example

In a realistic setting, the _act method could interface with APIs (e.g., flight or hotel booking services).

3. Society of Mind (SoM)
	•	File: society_of_mind.py
	•	Classes: SubAgent, SocietyOfMind
	•	Description:
	•	Manages multiple specialized sub-agents.
	•	Sub-agents collaborate, each solving part of the broader task.
	•	Combines solutions for a comprehensive result.

Usage

python society_of_mind.py

Sample Output:

MathAgent (Math) -> Performing math operations for 'Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5'
LanguageAgent (Language) -> Parsing language constructs for 'Then explain the formula in simple terms'

Each SubAgent has a solve_func defining how it handles its portion of the task.

4. SoMinE Prompt (Society of Mind-Inspired Engineering Prompt)
	•	File: somine_prompt.py
	•	Class: SoMinEPrompt
	•	Description:
	1.	Socratic Inquiry: Ask clarifying questions about context.
	2.	Minimally Elicited Instruction: Provide concise, direct instructions.
	3.	Reflection: Analytical review for insights and challenges.
	4.	Final Answer: Summarize all findings into a cohesive solution.

Usage

python somine_prompt.py

Sample Output:

Step 1: What assumptions are we making about 'Designing a new software architecture'?
Step 2: Given the context 'Designing a new software architecture', focus on the key objective and address it directly with minimal extra details.
Step 3: Considering the context 'Designing a new software architecture' and instructions, we can confirm the main challenge and potential solutions.
Step 4: Solution for 'Designing a new software architecture':
1) Address assumptions.
2) Provide a succinct instruction-based approach.
3) Reflect and refine.
4) Deliver final, cohesive answer.

This framework is particularly useful for structured problem exploration and ensuring thoroughness.

5. Tool-Use Enhanced Agents
	•	File: tool_use_agent.py
	•	Classes: ToolRegistry, ToolUseAgent
	•	Description:
	•	Integrates external tools (e.g., calculators, search engines) to solve tasks.
	•	Dynamically decides whether and when to use a tool.
	•	Facilitates open-ended problem-solving with real-time data.

Usage

python tool_use_agent.py

Sample Output:

Using calculator for task 'Calculate the sum of 4 and 5.'. Result = 9
Using search engine for query 'the best python tutorials online.'. Result = Mocked search result for 'the best python tutorials online.'
No relevant tool detected for 'Just do something else.'.

You can easily extend the ToolRegistry with additional tools for domain-specific tasks (e.g., weather APIs, translation services, data analytics, etc.).

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/agent_methods.git
cd agent_methods


	2.	(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  ## On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: The examples above are self-contained and require no special external libraries.)

How to Extend
	•	Chain-of-Thought: Replace the _decompose_question and _solve_subproblem methods with more sophisticated parsing and solver logic for domain-specific tasks.
	•	ReAct: Implement real APIs or environment calls in _act to make the agent truly interactive.
	•	Society of Mind: Add more sub-agents with specialized solve_funcs (e.g., image recognition, sentiment analysis).
	•	SoMinE Prompt: Expand each step with more robust question-generation, reflection heuristics, or user interaction.
	•	Tool-Use Enhanced Agents: Add new tools to the ToolRegistry, such as internet search, knowledge bases, or external ML models.
