## Algorithm Implementation

Here is a Python implementation of the algorithm based on the SoMinE_Prompt structure:

```python
def somine_algorithm(context_input):
    """
    Algorithm to implement the SoMinE_Prompt structure for solving a problem systematically.

    Parameters:
        context_input (str): The initial context or problem statement provided.

    Returns:
        str: The comprehensive solution based on the steps of Socratic Inquiry, Minimally Elicited Instruction, Reflection, and Final Answer.
    """
    ## Step 1: Socratic Inquiry
    def socratic_inquiry(context):
        """
        Ask clarifying questions to gather a full understanding of the problem.
        """
        questions = [
            "What specific details or background information are necessary to comprehend the issue at hand?",
            "Are there any assumptions or constraints that need to be clarified?",
            "What is the desired outcome of the solution?"
        ]
        return {"context": context, "questions": questions}

    ## Step 2: Minimally Elicited Instruction

        }

    ## Algorithm Workflow
    inquiry_output = socratic_inquiry(context_input)
    instruction_output = minimally_elicited_instruction(inquiry_output)
    reflection_output = reflection(instruction_output)
    final_output = final_answer(reflection_output)

    return final_output
```

### Example Usage
```python
problem_context = "We need to develop a structured problem-solving framework for complex issues."
result = somine_algorithm(problem_context)

# Print the final result
import pprint
pprint.pprint(result)
```

### Explanation
1. **Socratic Inquiry**: Focuses on asking questions to understand the problem fully.
2. **Minimally Elicited Instruction**: Provides concise steps to approach the problem.
3. **Reflection**: Analyzes insights, challenges, and considerations.
4. **Final Answer**: Combines all steps to deliver a comprehensive solution.

This algorithm processes the input problem step-by-step and outputs a structured solution in line with the SoMinE_Prompt methodology.

## Object-Oriented Implementation

Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm following SOLID principles and Object-Oriented Design (OOD):

```python
class SocraticInquiry:
    """
    Class for the Socratic Inquiry step.
    """
    def __init__(self, context):
        self.context = context

    def ask_questions(self):
        """
        Ask clarifying questions to fully understand the problem.
        """
        return [
            "What specific details or background information are necessary to comprehend the issue at hand?",
            "Are there any assumptions or constraints that need to be clarified?",
            "What is the desired outcome of the solution?"
        ]


class MinimallyElicitedInstruction:
    """
    Class for the Minimally Elicited Instruction step.
    """
    def __init__(self, context_analysis):
        self.context_analysis = context_analysis

    def provide_instructions(self):
        """
        Provide concise and precise instructions to resolve the problem.
        """
        return [
            "Identify the core elements of the problem.",
            "Outline a step-by-step approach to address the issue.",
            "Ensure the solution aligns with the desired outcome."
        ]


class Reflection:
    """

    def analyze(self):
        """
        Reflect on insights, challenges, and factors influencing the solution.
        """
        return {
            "challenges": [
                "What potential obstacles might arise during implementation?",
                "Are there alternative approaches to consider?"
            ],
            "insights": "Prioritize the most effective and efficient approach to solve the problem."
        }


class FinalAnswer:
    """
    Class for the Final Answer step.
    """
    def __init__(self, reflection_output):
        self.reflection_output = reflection_output

    def generate_solution(self):
        """
        Formulate a comprehensive solution based on all prior steps.
        """
        return {
            "summary": "Use the insights gained to implement the solution step-by-step.",
            "details": "Each step should be tested and validated to ensure correctness and feasibility."
        }


class SoMinEAlgorithm:
    """
    High-level orchestrator class to implement the SoMinE_Prompt workflow.
    """
    def __init__(self, context):
        self.context = context

    def execute(self):
        ## Step 1: Socratic Inquiry
        inquiry = SocraticInquiry(self.context)
        inquiry_output = inquiry.ask_questions()

        ## Step 2: Minimally Elicited Instruction
        instruction = MinimallyElicitedInstruction(inquiry_output)
        instruction_output = instruction.provide_instructions()

        ## Step 3: Reflection
        reflection = Reflection(instruction_output)
        reflection_output = reflection.analyze()

        ## Step 4: Final Answer
        final_answer = FinalAnswer(reflection_output)
        solution = final_answer.generate_solution()

        return solution
```

### Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    problem_context = "We need to develop a structured problem-solving framework for complex issues."
    somine_algorithm = SoMinEAlgorithm(problem_context)
    final_solution = somine_algorithm.execute()

    ## Display the result
    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(final_solution)
```

### SOLID Principles Explanation
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each class (e.g., SocraticInquiry, MinimallyElicitedInstruction, Reflection, and FinalAnswer) has a single, well-defined responsibility.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Each class is open for extension but closed for modification. New steps can be added by creating additional classes without altering existing ones.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Each component behaves predictably and can be substituted (if generalized further using interfaces or inheritance).

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - Classes have clearly defined, specific methods; they don't depend on methods they don't use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level logic in SoMinEAlgorithm depends on abstractions (SocraticInquiry, Reflection, etc.), not on low-level implementations.

### Benefits of OOD and SOLID
1. **Modularity**: Each class handles a specific step, making it easy to debug and test.
2. **Scalability**: Steps can be modified or new steps added without breaking the existing workflow.
3. **Readability**: The code is organized and easier to understand due to separation of concerns.
4. **Reusability**: Each class can be reused independently in other contexts.
