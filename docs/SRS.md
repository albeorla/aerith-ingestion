### 2. Integrated Agent Framework

#### 2.1 Overview

The `albeorla-aerith-aerith-ingestion` repository implements a cutting-edge agent-based system leveraging Socratic and minimally elicited reasoning paradigms. Socratic reasoning systematically formulates insightful questions to identify constraints, gaps, and assumptions, while minimally elicited reasoning extracts actionable insights from sparse input data. Together, these approaches foster a dynamic and adaptable architecture capable of addressing complex workflows and evolving operational requirements.
