## Current Sprint Goals: API Layer

### 1. Implement tRPC Routers

#### 1.1 Base Router Setup

#### 1.2 Entity-Specific Routers
Tasks for each entity type:
- [ ] Purpose Router
  - Create with validation
  - List with filters
  - Update with status transitions
  - Delete with cascade
  - Get by ID with relations

- [ ] Vision Router
  - Create with purpose validation
  - List by purpose
  - Update with status workflow
  - Delete with cascade
  - Get by ID with relations

- [ ] Goal Router
  - Create with vision validation
  - List by vision
  - Update with status workflow
  - Delete with cascade
  - Get by ID with relations

- [ ] Area Router
  - Create with goal validation
  - List by goal
  - Update with status workflow
  - Delete with cascade
  - Get by ID with relations

- [ ] Project Router
  - Create with area validation
  - List by area
  - Update with status workflow
  - Delete with cascade
  - Get by ID with relations

- [ ] Task Router
  - Create with project validation
  - List by project
  - Update with status workflow
  - Delete
  - Get by ID with relations

### 2. UI Components

#### 2.1 Entity Management Interface
For each entity type:
- [ ] Create form component
- [ ] Add list view with hierarchy
- [ ] Implement status toggles
- [ ] Add error handling

## Testing Priority
1. ✅ Schema validation
2. ✅ Database constraints
3. ✅ Sample data integrity
4. [ ] API input validation
5. [ ] Status transitions
6. [ ] Hierarchical integrity
7. [ ] User isolation
